                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Asiya's Flowers opened its doors in 2018 as a small studio with a big dream: to bring the timeless beauty of flowers into the lives of our neighbors and community. What began as a passion project creating arrangements for friends and family quickly grew into a beloved boutique flower shop in the heart of the Flower District. Today, we're honored to be the go-to floral studio for weddings, celebrations, and everyday moments of beauty throughout the region. Our journey from a humble home studio to a full-service floral design destination is a testament to the trust our customers have placed in us—and we never take that for granted.</p>

                        <h2>Why It All Began</h2>
                        <p>Asiya's love for flowers traces back to childhood summers spent in her grandmother's garden, where she discovered that every bloom carries its own personality, meaning, and story. Those early mornings surrounded by roses, jasmine, and wildflowers planted a seed that would eventually blossom into a career. After years of working in corporate settings, Asiya realized that her true calling was creating beauty that brings people together. She took a leap of faith, enrolled in floral design courses, and spent years apprenticing with master florists before opening her own studio. The decision wasn't just about starting a business—it was about honoring a lifelong connection to nature and sharing that joy with others.</p>

                    For us, floral design is so much more than arranging flowers—it's a form of artistic expression that connects people to nature and to each other. We approach every arrangement as a unique creative challenge, carefully considering color harmonies, textures, seasonal availability, and the emotions we want to evoke. Whether we're designing a romantic bridal bouquet, a vibrant birthday surprise, or a serene sympathy arrangement, we pour our hearts into every stem.
                </p>
                <p style="color: var(--color-text-light); font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    We constantly draw inspiration from art, fashion, nature, and the stories our clients share with us. Our designers stay current with global floral trends while honoring timeless techniques passed down through generations. This blend of innovation and tradition allows us to create arrangements that feel both fresh and enduring—pieces that capture a moment in time while standing the test of it.
